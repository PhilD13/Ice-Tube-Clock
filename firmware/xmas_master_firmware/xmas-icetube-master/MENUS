"cfg alar"  --  Configure Alarm
  "a. sound"
    Change the alarm sound.  Choices are high frequency beeps ("beeps hi"),
    low frequency beeps ("beeps lo"), high frequency three beep pulse
    ("pulse hi"), low frequency three beep pulse ("pulse lo"),
    Merry Christmas ("mery chr"), Big Ben ("big ben "), Reveille ("reveille"),
    or For He's a Jolly Good Fellow ("jly good").

  "a. volume"  
    Set the alarm volume or enable progressive alarm ("vol prog").  With the
    progressive alarm option, the user is prompted for the minimum volume
    ("v. min XX"), maximum volume ("v. max XX"), and ramp time in minutes
    ("time XX").  The alarm will start at the minimum volume and gradually
    reach the maximum volume over the specified ramp time.

  "a. snooze"
    Change the snooze time (minutes).

  "a. pulse"
    Enable or disable display brightness pulsing during alarm and snooze.


"cfg disp"  --  Configure the Display

  "disp bri"
    Set display brightness or enable automatic dimming ("bri auto").  With
    automatic dimming the user is prompted for the minimum ("b. min XX") and
    maximum ("b. max XX") brightness.

    The autodim minimum and maximum values may range from -5 to
    20---beyond the allowed brightness range of 0 to 10.  The actual
    display brightness, however, will never be brighter or dimmer than
    allowed to ensure that the display will always be visible and prevent
    display damage.

    With the autodim feature, display brightness is calculated from
    photoresistor voltage.  In the dark, voltage is highest and decreases
    as the ambient light increases.  The minimum and maximum autodim
    values set the brightness at 5 volts and ground level.  Display
    brightness is linearly interpolated from the photoresistor voltage.
    If the interpolation yields a value above or below the allowed
    brightness, display brightness is changed to the minimum or maximum
    allowed brightness, respectively.

    In normal clock use, photoresistor voltages change over only part of
    the 0 to 5 volt range.  So setting the autodim thresholds below and
    above the minimum and maximum provides more flexibility when
    configuring autodimming.


  "digt bri"
    Adjust the brightness of each individual digit to compensate for
    inconsistent digit brightness.

  "auto off" -- Automatic Display Off
    Some users may wish to inactivate the display when no one is around, as
    doing so will extend VFD lifetime.  Other users may wish to inactivate the
    display at night, as extra light can interfere with sleep.  When the
    display is inactive, pressing any button will enable the display on for
    one minute.

    "off dark"
      Enable or disable automatic inactivation at night (when dark).
      This option is only available if the automatic dimmer is enabled,
      which requires a photoresistor and 10k pull-up.

    "off time"
      Enable or disable automatic inactivation during certain hours.
      For example, if the clock is at the workplace of someone with a 9-to-5
      schedule, the display may be disabled from 5:00pm to 9:00am.

    "off days"
      Enable or disable automatic inactivation during certain days.
      For example, if the clock is at the workplace of someone with a
      Monday-through-Friday schedule, the display may be disabled during
      weekends.

    "on days "
      Force the display to be active on certain days (overrides off time).
      For example, if the clock is at the home of a person with a 9-to-5
      Monday-through-Friday schedule, they might set the "off time" to 9:00am
      to 5:00 pm and set the "on days" to weekends, so the display would be
      enabled whenever the person is home.

  "animated" 
    Enable or disable animated display transitions.


"cfg regn" -- Configure Regional Preferences

  "set dst"
    Configure daylight saving time.  The user may manually enable ("dst on")
    or disable ("dst off") daylight saving time.  Alternatively, the user
    may configure automatic enabling and disabling of DST by United States
    ("dst usa") or European Union ("dst eu") rules.

  "set zone"
    Configure the timezone relative to UTC/GMT.  This option is only available
    with the GPS timekeeping mod and is used to convert UTC/GMT time from the
    GPS to local time.

  "time fmt"
    Configure the time format.

  "date fmt"
    Configure the date format.

  "misc fmt"
    Configure how numbers and letters are displayed.
