## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ##
######################

  * Limor Fried and the Adafruit team, of course, design and
    manufacture the wonderful Ice Tube Clock clock kit.

  * The Adafruit hacker community deserves oodles of credit for their
    insights, discussions, and feedback in the Adafruit Clocks forums:
    http://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=41

  * Ray Ramirez contributed code, made useful suggestions, and provided
    helpful advice.

  * Jens Gutsche suggested implementing alternative date formats and
    disabling the display at scheduled times to extend the IV-18 tube
    lifetime.

  * Jeremy Fitzhardinge's iceclock was the inspiration for the display
    transitions and display pulsing during alarm and snooze.

  * William Phelps's firmware was the inspiration for the progressive
    alarm functionality, although his project uses a different approach.

## OTHER FIRMWARE PROJECTS ##

Many of the improvements in the xmas-icetube were first implemented in
other alternative firmware.  Although I have not personally tried all
those mentioned below, I have heard they all provide wonderful
improvements over the original software.  Note that some of these
require code modification to compile on recent versions of avr-gcc:
