Ice Tube Clock - PhilD13

This is my working directory fork of the icetube clock from Adafruit that will incoroprate various board changes and component updates as I learn more about Eagle Cad.


The working directory is where the latest working files are located. 

Current board edits include a reroute of a couple traces including adding a VIA,
Fattening of VCC and GND traces in various areas
Making the board slightly wider (we will see how it fits in the case when the boards get back)
Moving the Atmega328P down some
Changing some silk screen on components so the screen does not cross the pads

Schematic
Changing name of the Atmega
changing values of certain components such as R3
changing values of C8 and C9
changing Q4 to ZVP2110A FET (still P-channel) so mount backwards from silk screen
